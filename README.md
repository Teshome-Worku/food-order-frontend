Food Order Frontend is a modern and responsive food ordering web application built with React and Tailwind CSS.

The project focuses on creating a clean, user-friendly interface for browsing food menus, adding items to a cart, and preparing orders for submission. It is designed with scalability and real-world usage in mind, following best practices in component structure, routing, and UI design.

Key features include a modern landing page, menu listing with food cards, cart-ready interactions, and client-side routing using React Router for smooth navigation. The UI is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring an accessible and intuitive user experience.

This frontend is intended to integrate with a backend API for order processing and real-time notifications (such as Telegram bot integration) in later stages. The project demonstrates practical frontend development skills, clean code organization, and an understanding of building real-world web applications.
